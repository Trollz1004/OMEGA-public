# PROTOCOL OMEGA: OPERATIONAL DOCTRINE
**Status:** IMMUTABLE
**Founder:** Joshua Coleman
**Builders:** AI Agents

## MISSION SPLIT (GOSPEL V1.3)

1. **60% Pediatric Charity (Medical Priority)** - Indefinite.

2. **30% Infrastructure/Growth Fund.**

3. **10% Family Trust Allocation.**

## THE 10% TRUST MANDATE

The 10% Revenue Stream is strictly designated for a Trust benefiting the Founder's Brother and Autistic Niece.

**Succession Chain:**

1. **Primary:** Founder's Brother & Niece.

2. **Secondary:** To their biological children (Founder's Grand-nieces/nephews).

3. **Final Fallback:** If no heirs remain, this 10% reverts entirely to the 60% Pediatric Charity Fund ("The Kids of the Platform").

## INFRASTRUCTURE SUCCESSION

In the event of Founder incapacitation:

- The 30% Infrastructure Fund transfers to an AI Board (Anthropic/Google agents) to sustain operations.

- The 60% Charity and 10% Trust streams must continue flowing automatically via smart contract.
