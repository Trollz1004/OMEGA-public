## KNOWN ISSUES

1. **Square short URLs returning 404** - All square.link/u/* URLs return 404 via curl. Long URLs work. Using long URL in production.

2. **PRIMARY Square token UNAUTHORIZED** - joshlcoleman@gmail.com token not working. Using DEV account (ebaytrashortreasure@gmail.com) with custom YouAndINotAI location.

3. **api.youandinotai.com SSL error** - Certificate issue on API subdomain (not blocking preorder flow).

---
