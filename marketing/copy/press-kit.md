## Boilerplate

### Short (50 words)

FOR THE KIDS is a blockchain-powered charitable giving platform that directs 100% of AI platform revenue to verified pediatric charities. Using immutable smart contracts on Base Mainnet, the platform eliminates trust from charitable giving - making every donation verifiable, automatic, and permanent.

### Medium (100 words)

FOR THE KIDS reimagines charitable giving through blockchain technology. Built on Base Mainnet, the platform uses immutable smart contracts to guarantee that 100% of AI platform revenue goes directly to verified pediatric charities. Unlike traditional donation platforms that require trust, FOR THE KIDS makes charity mathematically certain - the code cannot be changed, the allocations cannot be altered, and every transaction is publicly auditable. The platform operates under Gospel V1.4.1 SURVIVAL MODE, a transitional phase focused on building sustainable infrastructure while maintaining unwavering commitment to its charitable mission. The tagline says it all: "Until no kid is in need."

### Long (200 words)

FOR THE KIDS represents a fundamental shift in how charitable giving works. Traditional platforms ask donors to trust that funds will be properly allocated. FOR THE KIDS eliminates trust entirely by encoding charitable allocation rules into immutable smart contracts on Base Mainnet.

The platform's flagship product, the AI Solutions Store, operates under a radical promise: 100% of revenue goes to verified pediatric charities. This isn't a marketing claim or a corporate pledge - it's code. The CharityRouter100 smart contract automatically routes all incoming funds to designated charity wallets. No human intervention. No accounting. No possibility of error or corruption.

The platform also includes a dating app operating under SURVIVAL MODE - a transitional phase where revenue supports founder operations until sustainability is achieved. Once operational goals are met, governance transitions to a DAO with the founder allocation permanently capped at 10%.

Every transaction is visible on the blockchain. Every allocation is auditable. Every promise is enforced by code rather than goodwill. This is charitable giving rebuilt from first principles - transparent, automatic, and permanent.

FOR THE KIDS: "Until no kid is in need."

## Spokesperson Quotes

### On Mission

"We built FOR THE KIDS because we believe charitable giving shouldn't require trust. With blockchain technology, we can make donations verifiable, automatic, and permanent. When we say 100% goes to charity, the code proves it."

### On Technology

"Smart contracts allow us to encode our values into immutable code. The CharityRouter100 contract will route funds to verified pediatric charities forever. No board decision, no corporate pivot, and no scandal can ever change that."

### On Transparency

"Traditional charities publish annual reports. We publish every transaction in real-time on the blockchain. Our transparency isn't a feature - it's the foundation of everything we build."

### On SURVIVAL MODE

"We're in SURVIVAL MODE because sustainable infrastructure requires sustainable funding. The dating app supports operations today so the AI platforms can donate 100% to charity forever. It's a bridge to a better model, not a compromise of our values."
