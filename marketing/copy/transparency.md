## Smart Contract Addresses

### AI Solutions Store (100% Charity)

- **CharityRouter100**: `0x9855B75061D4c841791382998f0CE8B2BCC965A4`
- **Allocation**: 100% to verified pediatric charities
- **Status**: IMMUTABLE (cannot be changed)
- **Network**: Base Mainnet
- [View on BaseScan](https://basescan.org/address/0x9855B75061D4c841791382998f0CE8B2BCC965A4)

The CharityRouter100 contract is designed with permanent, unchangeable allocation rules. Once deployed, no one - not even the developers - can modify where the funds go. This is charity you can verify.

### Dating App (DAO Treasury)

- **DatingRevenueRouter**: `[CONTRACT ADDRESS]`
- **Current Phase**: SURVIVAL MODE
- **Current Split**: 100% Founder (temporary)
- **Next Phase**: DAO governance with founder cap of 10% maximum
- [View on BaseScan](https://basescan.org/)

The dating app operates under a transitional model. During SURVIVAL MODE, revenue supports platform development and founder sustainability. Once operational goals are met, governance transitions to a DAO where the founder allocation is permanently capped at 10%.

## How to Audit Our Platform

### Step 1: Visit BaseScan

Navigate to the contract addresses above. All code is verified and readable.

### Step 2: Read the Source Code

Every function, every rule, every allocation is visible in the verified contract source.

### Step 3: Check Distribution Events

All payments emit `Distribution` events. Track every outgoing transaction:

```
Event: Distribution(recipient, amount, timestamp)
```

### Step 4: View Pending Splits

Check the contract state to see pending distributions and their ETAs.

### Step 5: Verify Charity Receipts

Verified pediatric charities provide donation receipts that can be cross-referenced with blockchain transactions.

## Revenue Model

### AI Platforms (Permanent)

| Source | Allocation | Recipient |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| AI Solutions Store | 100% | Verified Pediatric Charities |
| API Subscriptions | 100% | Verified Pediatric Charities |
| Enterprise Licenses | 100% | Verified Pediatric Charities |

This allocation is **permanent and immutable**. The smart contract enforces this rule at the code level, making it technically impossible to change.

### Dating App (Transitional)

| Phase | Founder | DAO Treasury | Charity |
|-------|---------|--------------|---------|
| SURVIVAL MODE (Current) | 100% | 0% | 0% |
| Growth Phase | 50% | 30% | 20% |
| Mature Phase | 10% (capped) | 60% | 30% |

The dating app follows a responsible growth model. SURVIVAL MODE ensures the platform can achieve sustainability before transitioning to community governance.

## Why Blockchain?

Traditional donation platforms require trust. You trust that the organization will allocate funds as promised. You trust their accounting. You trust their reporting.

We eliminated trust from the equation.

With blockchain-based smart contracts:

- **No manual intervention**: Funds route automatically
- **No accounting errors**: Code executes perfectly every time
- **No hidden fees**: Gas costs are the only overhead
- **No broken promises**: Immutable code cannot change its mind

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you change the 100% charity allocation?

**No.** The CharityRouter100 contract is immutable. There is no admin function, no upgrade mechanism, and no backdoor. Once deployed, the rules are permanent.

### How do I know the charities are real?

We work exclusively with verified pediatric charities that provide:
- 501(c)(3) documentation
- Public financial audits
- Transparent fund utilization reports

### What is SURVIVAL MODE?

SURVIVAL MODE is a transitional phase for the dating app where revenue supports founder operations and platform development. This phase ends when predefined sustainability metrics are achieved, after which governance transitions to a DAO.

### How can I track my donation?

Every transaction is recorded on Base Mainnet. When you make a purchase:
1. Note the transaction hash
2. View it on BaseScan
3. Follow the funds to the charity wallet
4. Request a receipt from the charity

### What are the gas costs?

Gas costs on Base Mainnet are minimal (typically under $0.01 per transaction). These are the only costs not going to charity, and they are necessary for blockchain operation.
