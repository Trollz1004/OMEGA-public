### Email 2: Profile Tips (Day 1)
**Subject:** 3 profile tweaks that 10x your matches
**Preview:** What successful Spark users do differently...

---

Hey [First Name],

Fun fact: Users who complete these 3 profile elements get 10x more quality matches on Spark.

**1. Add 4-6 photos (including one activity shot)**
Show different sides of yourself. Your first photo should be a clear face shot. Include at least one photo doing something you love.

**2. Write a bio that invites conversation**
Instead of: "Love to travel and try new food"
Try: "Just got back from Japan and I'm obsessed with finding authentic ramen in the city. Know any spots?"

**3. Answer at least 3 personality prompts**
These help our algorithm AND give your matches something to talk about.

[Optimize My Profile - Button]

Here's a secret: Our algorithm prioritizes showing complete profiles to other complete profiles. Quality attracts quality.

Happy matching,

The Spark Team

### Email 3: First Match Tips (Day 2)
**Subject:** What to do when you get your first match
**Preview:** The first message makes all the difference...

---

Hey [First Name],

Matches are coming in, and we want to make sure you're set up for great conversations.

**The art of the first message:**

Don't: "Hey" "Hi" "What's up"
Do: Reference something specific from their profile

**Example openers that work:**
- "I saw you're into hiking - what's the best trail you've done recently?"
- "A fellow [TV show] fan! Team [character] or team [character]?"
- "That photo in [location] looks amazing. What was the highlight of that trip?"

**Pro tip:** Stuck? Tap the lightbulb icon on any profile and our AI will suggest personalized openers based on their interests.

[Open Spark - Button]

The goal isn't just to match - it's to connect. Make that first message count.

Cheers,

The Spark Team

Hey [First Name],

You've been chatting with some great matches. Ready to take it to the next level?

**Introducing Video Dating on Spark**

Before you commit to meeting up, hop on a quick video call right in the app. It's the perfect way to:

- Check if the chemistry translates IRL
- Make sure they match their photos (safety first!)
- Skip the awkward "are they who they say they are" anxiety
- Have a real conversation before spending time/money on a date

**How it works:**
1. Match with someone and start chatting
2. When you're ready, tap the video icon
3. They'll get a notification to accept
4. Enjoy a video date from the comfort of home

[Try Video Dating - Button]

Over 70% of Spark users who video date before meeting say it made their first in-person date way better.

Go connect,

These are your highest-scoring connections. Worth prioritizing!
