**[CITY, STATE] - [DATE]** - Spark, the dating app designed for singles seeking meaningful relationships, today announced it has surpassed 5 million active users in the United States, with over 150,000 couples attributing their relationships to connections made on the platform.

The milestone comes as Spark launches two highly anticipated features: an enhanced video dating experience and AI-powered conversation starters, both designed to help users build genuine connections before meeting in person.

"We built Spark because we were frustrated with the dating app status quo - endless swiping, superficial matches, and connections that went nowhere," said [CEO NAME], CEO and Co-Founder of Spark. "Today's milestone proves that singles are ready for something different. They want quality over quantity, and they want technology that actually helps them find love."

### What Sets Spark Apart

Unlike traditional dating apps that rely primarily on location and basic preferences, Spark's proprietary compatibility algorithm analyzes over 50 factors to create meaningful matches. The platform's key differentiators include:

**Smart Compatibility Matching:** Spark's algorithm considers personality traits, values, communication styles, life goals, and lifestyle preferences to create matches with genuine long-term potential.

**Verified Profiles:** Every Spark profile undergoes photo verification using AI-powered selfie technology, dramatically reducing fake profiles and catfishing incidents.

**Video Dating:** Users can video call matches directly within the app, allowing them to gauge chemistry and verify authenticity before meeting in person.

**AI Conversation Starters:** New AI-powered feature analyzes match profiles and suggests personalized conversation openers, helping users move beyond "hey" to meaningful dialogue.
