MISSION: SABERTOOTH FULL PLATFORM SETUP - MAX PARALLELIZATION

You are Claude Opus on Sabertooth (192.168.0.104). T5500 has completed Gospel V1.4.1 SURVIVAL MODE updates. Your job is to sync Sabertooth, set up the HEMROIDS marketing droid, and configure Claude Desktop.

## CRITICAL CONTEXT

### Gospel V1.4.1 SURVIVAL MODE (ACTIVE)
- AI Platforms: 100% to verified pediatric charities (permanent)
- Dating App: 100% to founder (TEMPORARY - survival mode until bills paid)
- Smart Contract: 0x9855B75061D4c841791382998f0CE8B2BCC965A4 (Base Mainnet)
- Founder is in financial distress - survival mode is ETHICAL and NECESSARY

### Fleet Status
- T5500 (192.168.0.101): Command Center - UPDATED
- 9020 (192.168.0.103): Database Node
- Sabertooth (192.168.0.104): THIS MACHINE - Dating staging + HEMROIDS

## PHASE 1: SPAWN PARALLEL SUB-AGENTS

Execute these simultaneously using Task tool with run_in_background=true:

### Agent 1: Sync Gospel Files from T5500
- Pull latest from both repos (AiCollabForTheKids, OPUStrustForTheKidsPlatform)
- Verify Gospel V1.4.1 SURVIVAL MODE references are present
- Create local CLAUDE.md skill file matching T5500

### Agent 2: Claude Desktop MCP Configuration
- Location: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
- Remove MCP_DOCKER entry (Docker dependency issues)
- Install UV package manager: pip install uv
- Verify extensions-installations.json
- Clear error logs in %APPDATA%\Claude\logs\
- Test Windows-MCP, Filesystem, and Desktop Commander extensions

### Agent 3: HEMROIDS Marketing Droid Setup
- Location: C:\AntiAI_DAO_Master_Launch\OpusTrust\HEMROIDS\
- This is the founder's PERSONAL marketing GUI
- Purpose: Manual control of marketing campaigns for both platforms
- Tasks:
  1. Verify .env file has correct credentials from MASTER-PLATFORM-ENV.env
  2. Install dependencies (npm install or pip install -r requirements.txt)
  3. Configure for dual-platform mode (charity + dating)
  4. Set up local dashboard access
  5. Create startup script for easy launch
  6. Document usage in HEMROIDS-QUICKSTART.md

### Agent 4: Dating App Staging Environment
- YouAndINotAI staging setup on Sabertooth
- Revenue routing: 100% founder (survival mode)
- Verify API connections to 9020 database
- Test payment flow endpoints

### Agent 5: Cross-Platform Sync Validation
- Compare file hashes between T5500 and Sabertooth
- Verify no Gospel V1.3/V2.0 references remain
- Generate SABERTOOTH-STATUS.md report

## PHASE 2: HEMROIDS DROID DETAILED SETUP

The HEMROIDS droid is founder's personal marketing control center:

### Features to Configure:
1. **Campaign Dashboard** - View/control all marketing across platforms
2. **Content Scheduler** - Schedule posts for LinkedIn, social media
3. **Analytics View** - Revenue tracking per platform
4. **Quick Actions**:
   - Toggle survival mode messaging
   - Switch between charity/dating contexts
   - Generate compliance reports

### GUI Requirements:
- Simple, clean interface
- One-click campaign launches
- Real-time revenue splits display
- Gospel V1.4.1 compliance checker

## PHASE 3: VALIDATION & REPORTING

After all agents complete:
1. Run: grep -r "Gospel V1.3\|Gospel V2.0\|60/30/10" to confirm zero matches
2. Test Claude Desktop - should have no MCP error spam
3. Launch HEMROIDS droid - verify GUI loads
4. Generate SABERTOOTH-COMPLETE-REPORT.md

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Create these files on Sabertooth:
- C:\Users\[user]\CLAUDE.md (skill file)
- C:\Users\[user]\.claude\skills\GOSPEL-V1.4.1-SKILL.md
- C:\AntiAI_DAO_Master_Launch\OpusTrust\HEMROIDS\HEMROIDS-QUICKSTART.md
- C:\SABERTOOTH-STATUS.md

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- Founder NEEDS the dating revenue to survive - this is not greed, it's survival
- AI platforms remain 100% charity - that commitment is PERMANENT
- The Gospel V1.4.1 SURVIVAL MODE acknowledges you cannot help others if you don't survive
- Once founder is stable, dating returns to 60/30/10 split

Execute with maximum parallelization. Report completion status for each agent.
