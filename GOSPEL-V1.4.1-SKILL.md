- **Target Transition:** Return to standard revenue allocation after financial stability

### Current Allocations:

|-------------|------------|-------|
| **AI Platforms** (AiCollabForTheKids) | 100% CHARITY | All revenue to verified pediatric charities |
| **Dating App** (YouAndINotAI) | 100% FOUNDER | Temporary - survival mode only |

### Post-Survival Mode (Future):
- Dating App transitions to: 60% Charity / 30% DAO Treasury / 10% Founder
